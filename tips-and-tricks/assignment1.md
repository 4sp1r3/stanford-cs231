### Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier

#### Level up your numpy

You'll realize after going through the first question that a strong understanding of numpy will be essential.  Jake VanderPlas is one of my favorite data scientist to follow when it comes to numpy.  Check out his fantastic talk on [how you can speed up your python code with numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEUXKG97YRw).

__For the hardcore__
> For help optimizing your KNN classifier, check out Christian Bauckhage's work on numpy and scipy.  Especially his papers on [Computing Nearest Neighbors](https://multimedia-pattern-recognition.info/fileadmin/Websites/mmprec/uploads/docs/Bauckhage/np-sp-rec-edm.pdf) and [Squared Euclidean Distance Matrices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266617010_NumPy_SciPy_Recipes_for_Data_Science_Squared_Euclidean_Distance_Matrices?channel=doi&linkId=543598a70cf2643ab9867c26&showFulltext=true).


### Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine

> The IPython Notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.


### Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier

> The IPython Notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

### Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network

> The IPython Notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

### Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features

> The IPython Notebook features.ipynb will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.


### Q6: Cool Bonus: Do something extra! (+10 points)

> Implement, investigate or analyze something extra surrounding the topics in this assignment, and using the code you developed. For example, is there some other interesting question we could have asked? Is there any insightful visualization you can plot? Or anything fun to look at? Or maybe you can experiment with a spin on the loss function? If you try out something cool weâ€™ll give you up to 10 extra points and may feature your results in the lecture.
